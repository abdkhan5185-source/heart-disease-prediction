# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various medical attributes using machine learning models.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset was obtained from a heart disease dataset (e.g. UCI repository or Kaggle). It contains features like age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
We evaluated each model using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

Final Model Performance:
- **Accuracy:** ~82%
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score:** ~82%

## ⚙️ Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📌 Goal
The initial goal was to reach 95% accuracy, but the achieved result was 82%, which is still meaningful for a baseline model.

## 💡 Next Steps
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Add feature engineering
- Improve model evaluation with cross-validation

## 📁 How to Run
Just open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step.
